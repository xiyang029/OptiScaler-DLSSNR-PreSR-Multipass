// Spreads Intel's generated frames out in time, so that multi frame generation
// above 2X stops arriving as one clump followed by a gap.
//
// The provider already knows what the spacing should be. Once per burst it
// works out how long a real frame took and divides it by the number of frames
// the burst will deliver:
//
//     0x220254  mov  r9, [r8+8]        ; count = generated frames in this burst
//     0x220258  lea  rcx, [r9+1]       ; count + 1 = the multiplier
//     0x22025E  mov  rax, [rbp-0x41]   ; duration of the real frame
//     0x220262  div  rcx
//     0x220265  mov  r12, rax          ; -> duration / multiplier, per frame
//
// but then the present loop that follows hands every generated frame straight
// to the swapchain back to back:
//
//     0x220280  ...                    ; loop over rbx = 1 .. count-1
//     0x2202E8  call 0x1800025c0       ; -> jmp 0x18021f730, present one frame
//     0x2202ED  ...
//     0x22030A  jb   0x180220280
//
// and `r12` is not consumed until the loop has finished, by the FPS limiter
// block at 0x220317 - which is itself only reached when count > 2 and two other
// conditions hold. So the burst goes out as fast as the swapchain accepts it and
// the limiter then holds the *last* frame of the burst back, which is what reads
// as frames being bunched up and out of order above 2X.
//
// The last frame is not presented from the loop at all. It goes out from the
// call at 0x220462, after the loop and after the provider has submitted the
// burst, so it needs pacing of its own:
//
//     0x220411  call 0x180003100       ; -> jmp 0x18021ee30, submit the burst
//     0x220445  mov  byte [rsp+0x30], 0
//     0x220462  call 0x1800025c0       ; present the last generated frame
//
// Fixing it means pacing each generated frame, which means getting in between
// the loop and the present. Every one of those presents goes through the 5 byte
// thunk at 0x25C0, and that thunk is followed by 11 bytes of int3 padding, so
// it is 16 bytes that contain nothing but a jump. That is room for a 14 byte
// `jmp qword ptr [rip+0]`, so the thunk can be redirected anywhere in the
// address space without relocating a single instruction and without a code cave.
//
// The thunk has two other callers (0x220A52, 0x220DAD), so the detour checks
// _ReturnAddress() and paces only the two sites above; every other present is
// forwarded untouched.
//
// The spacing is not invented here. The provider has a frame scheduler of its
// own - it just never calls it for the frames the loop presents, only for the
// burst's last one. So each of those presents is handed to 0x21EE30 with the
// arguments the present path already has, and the provider works out the
// presentation time itself. A wall clock does the same job when the scheduler
// cannot be reached; waiting on the provider's D3D12 fence as well was tried and
// then removed, see 08-PACING.md §7.7 for the measurements that killed it.

// 9 entry ring at ctx+0x168. Waiting on that same fence from here was tried
// and **removed again**: `WaitForSingleObject` rounds a short timeout up to
// the system timer tick, so every wait that expired overshot by ~7 ms, over
// half of them expired, and the measured gap between generated frames ended
// up 30-40% above the target the pacing was aiming for. The full numbers and
// the reasoning are in 08-PACING.md §4.6 and §7.7.
//
// The wall clock is now only the fallback, used when the scheduler below
// cannot be reached. Its real frame period is measured across two frames
// whose spacing is set by the scheduler's own timebase instead of being
// imposed, so it is reported rather than used to decide anything.

// --- the provider's own frame scheduler --------------------------------

// 0x3100 is another entry in the same thunk table as 0x25C0, and it is not
// what it looks like from inside 0x21EE30. That function is not "wait for
// the fence" - the fence wait is a short block it can skip. What it really
// does is schedule the frame: look the frame's record up in the ring at
// ctx+0x168 by burst->tag, stamp it with the current counter, then have
// 0x224B30 (via 0x3430) compute a presentation time from
//
//     f * arg5 / (count + 1) * K   clamped against  arg5 * *(arg4+8) / (count+1)
//     ... +/- corrections read out of the record
//
// and hand that time to 0x7A30. Its arg5 is the frame's *index* in the
// burst, and the provider's own call site (0x220411) passes burst->count -
// the index of the last generated frame, which is the only one that site is
// responsible for. So above 2X every intermediate frame goes out with no
// presentation time computed for it at all, which is a much better
// explanation of the ordering trouble than the missing fence wait was.
//
// All five of its arguments are reachable from the present's own arguments:
// arg2 is the burst (present arg5 - 0x38), arg5 is the index the loop is
// already walking, arg3 is burst[0xC0] & 1, and arg4 is what 0x4DA0 writes
// when given the ring:
//
//     0x22023D  lea  r14, [rsi + 0x168]   ; ring = ctx + 0x168
//     0x220244  lea  rdx, [rbp - 0x49]

// frame. He rebuilds those arguments through a 1500 byte helper (0x3F570)
// because he hooks without the present's arguments in hand; from inside the
// present they are free.
//
// A run with only a forwarding detour on the thunk confirmed all of it

// `(float)[lookup + 0x14]`, f is `clamp(ring[0x1B8], 0.125, 500.0)` read as
// a float in milliseconds, and `base` is a nanosecond timestamp written in

//
// Two consequences, both of them visible in a run:
//
//   * `base` is fresh only for index 1. For every other index it is whatever
//     that stack slot happened to hold, so the provider's own call - the one
//     that carries index == count, which above 2X is the only call it makes -
//     computes its deadline from garbage. 2X is the one multiplier where its
//     own call has index 1, and it is the one multiplier that ever worked.
//   * the min() clamps the step down to f, and f is smaller than a real frame
//     interval. Measured at 4X: 8.5 ms against a 20.6 ms frame, so the step
